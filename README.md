# **DataCamp**

### Notes, Code Exercises, Informations and Certificates of all the python, R, SQL, data-science, machine learning and other courses I have completed in DataCamp.

***Disclaimer:** Most of these solutions are made to actually run in DataCamp's exercise environment. So, most of them will not run properly in your machine because DataCamp preloaded some data and fuctions in the exercises, and I don't have them added here.*
